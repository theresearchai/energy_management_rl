abstract = {Demand response has the potential of reducing peaks of electricity demand by about 20% in the US, where buildings represent roughly 70% of the total electricity demand. Buildings are dynamic systems in constant change (i.e. occupants' behavior, refurbishment measures), which are costly to model and difficult to coordinate with other urban energy systems. Reinforcement learning is an adaptive control algorithm that can control these urban energy systems relying on historical and real-time data instead of models. Plenty of research has been conducted in the use of reinforcement learning for demand response applications in the last few years. However, most experiments are difficult to replicate, and the lack of standardization makes the performance of different algorithms difficult, if not impossible, to compare. In this demo, we introduce a new framework, CityLearn, based on the OpenAI Gym Environment, which will allow researchers to implement, share, replicate, and compare their implementations of reinforcement learning for demand response applications more easily. The framework is open source and modular, which allows researchers to modify and customize it, e.g., by adding additional storage, generation, or energy-consuming systems.},

abstract = {This paper presents an improved reinforcement learning method to minimize electricity costs on the premise of satisfying the power balance and generation limit of units in a microgrid with grid-connected mode. Firstly, the microgrid control requirements are analyzed and the objective function of optimal control for microgrid is proposed. Then, a state variable Average Electricity Price Trend which is used to express the most possible transitions of the system is developed so as to reduce the complexity and randomicity of the microgrid, and a multi-agent architecture including agents, state variables, action variables and reward function is formulated. Furthermore, dynamic hierarchical reinforcement learning, based on change rate of key state variable, is established to carry out optimal policy exploration. The analysis shows that the proposed method is beneficial to handle the problem of curse of dimensionality and speed up learning in the unknown large-scale world. Finally, the simulation results under JADE (Java Agent Development Framework) demonstrate the validity of the presented method in optimal control for a microgrid with grid-connected mode. {\textcopyright} 2012 ISA.},

abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning provides a promising approach for vision-based control of real-world robots. However, the generalization of such models depends critically on the quantity and variety of data available for training. This data can be difficult to obtain for some types of robotic systems, such as fragile, small-scale quadrotors. Simulated rendering and physics can provide for much larger datasets, but such data is inherently of lower quality: many of the phenomena that make the real-world autonomous flight problem challenging, such as complex physics and air currents, are modeled poorly or not at all, and the systematic differences between simulation and the real world are typically impossible to eliminate. In this work, we investigate how data from both simulation and the real world can be combined in a hybrid deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Our method uses real-world data to learn about the dynamics of the system, and simulated data to learn a generalizable perception system that can enable the robot to avoid collisions using only a monocular camera. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world nano aerial vehicle collision avoidance task, showing that with only an hour of real-world data, the quadrotor can avoid collisions in new environments with various lighting conditions and geometry.

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel framework for home energy management (HEM) based on reinforcement learning in achieving efficient home-based demand response (DR). The concerned hour-ahead energy consumption scheduling problem is duly formulated as a finite Markov decision process (FMDP) with discrete time steps. To tackle this problem, a data-driven method based on neural network (NN) and Q-learning algorithm is developed, which achieves superior performance on cost-effective schedules for HEM system. Specifically, real data of electricity price and solar photovoltaic (PV) generation are timely processed for uncertainty prediction by extreme learning machine (ELM) in the rolling time windows. The scheduling decisions of the household appliances and electric vehicles (EVs) can be subsequently obtained through the newly developed framework, of which the objective is dual, i.e., to minimize the electricity bill as well as the DR induced dissatisfaction. Simulations are performed on a residential house level with multiple home appliances, an EV and several PV panels. The test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven based HEM framework.},

abstract = {Demand response (DR) is very important in the future smart grid, aiming to encourage consumers to reduce their demand during peak load hours. However, if binary decision variables are needed to specify start-up time of a particular appliance, the resulting mixed integer combinatorial problem is in general difficult to solve. In this paper, we study a versatile convex programming (CP) DR optimization framework for the automatic load management of various household appliances in a smart home. In particular, an L1 regularization technique is proposed to deal with schedule-based appliances (SAs), for which their on/off statuses are governed by binary decision variables. By relaxing these variables from integer to continuous values, the problem is reformulated as a new CP problem with an additional L1 regularization term in the objective. This allows us to transform the original mixed integer problem into a standard CP problem. Its major advantage is that the overall DR optimization problem remains to be convex and therefore the solution can be found efficiently. Moreover, a wide variety of appliances with different characteristics can be flexibly incorporated. Simulation result shows that the energy scheduling of SAs and other appliances can be determined simultaneously using the proposed CP formulation. {\textcopyright} 2010-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Wang2016,
abstract = {Integrating residential photovoltaic (PV) power generation and energy storage systems into the Smart Grid is an effective way of reducing fossil fuel consumptions. This has become a particularly interesting problem with the introduction of dynamic electricity energy pricing, since consumers can use their PV-based energy generation and controllable energy storage devices for peak shaving on their power demand profile, thereby minimizing their electricity bill. A realistic electricity pricing function is considered with billing period of a month, comprising both an energy price component and a demand price component. Due to the characteristics of electricity price function and energy storage capacity limitation, the residential storage control algorithm should 1) utilize PV power generation and load power consumption predictions and 2) account for various energy loss components during system operation, including energy loss components due to rate capacity effect in the storage system and power dissipation of the power conversion circuitry. A near-optimal storage control algorithm is proposed accounting for these aspects. The near-optimal algorithm, which controls the charging/discharging of the storage system, is effectively implemented by solving a convex optimization problem at the beginning of each day with polynomial time complexity. For further improvement, the reinforcement learning technique is adopted to adaptively determine the residual energy in the storage system at the end of each day in a billing period.},

It allows the system to deal with major concerns of wide-area monitoring problem: delays in signal transmission, the uncertainty of the communication network, and data traffic. The main advantage of this design is its ability to learn from the past using eligibility traces and predict the optimal trajectory of cost function through temporal difference method. The control algorithm is evolved from adaptive critic design (ACD) and performed online at a finite horizon through backward and forward view.

The underlying framework is one of multi-criteria decision-making by an individual consumer who has the goals of increasing the utilization rate of the battery during high electricity demand (so as to decrease the electricity purchase from the external grid) and increasing the utilization rate of the wind turbine for local use (so as to increase the consumer independence from the external grid). Predictions of available wind power feed the reinforcement learning algorithm for selecting the optimal battery scheduling actions. The embedded learning mechanism allows to enhance the consumer knowledge about the optimal actions for battery scheduling under different time-dependent environmental conditions.

@article{Gemine2017,
abstract = {With the increasing share of renewable and distributed generation in electrical distribution systems, active network management (ANM) becomes a valuable option for a distribution system operator to operate his system in a secure and cost-effective way without relying solely on network reinforcement. ANM strategies are short-term policies that control the power injected by generators and/or taken off by loads in order to avoid congestion or voltage issues. While simple ANM strategies consist in curtailing temporary excess generation, more advanced strategies rather attempt to move the consumption of loads to anticipated periods of high renewable generation. However, such advanced strategies imply that the system operator has to solve large-scale optimal sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty. The problems are sequential for several reasons. For example, decisions taken at a given moment constrain the future decisions that can be taken, and decisions should be communicated to the actors of the system sufficiently in advance to grant them enough time for implementation. Uncertainty must be explicitly accounted for because neither demand nor generation can be accurately forecasted. We first formulate the ANM problem, which in addition to be sequential and uncertain, has a nonlinear nature stemming from the power flow equations and a discrete nature arising from the activation of power modulation signals. This ANM problem is then cast as a stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear program, as well as second-order cone and linear counterparts, for which we provide quantitative results using state of the art solvers and perform a sensitivity analysis over the size of the system, the amount of available flexibility, and the number of scenarios considered in the deterministic equivalent of the stochastic program. To foster further research on this problem, we make available at http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/$\sim$anm/ three test beds based on distribution networks of 5, 33, and 77 buses. These test beds contain a simulator of the distribution system, with stochastic models for the generation and consumption devices, and callbacks to implement and test various ANM strategies.},

abstract = {Demand response has the potential of reducing peaks of electricity demand by about 20% in the US, where buildings represent roughly 70% of the total electricity demand. Buildings are dynamic systems in constant change (i.e. occupants' behavior, refurbishment measures), which are costly to model and difficult to coordinate with other urban energy systems. Reinforcement learning is an adaptive control algorithm that can control these urban energy systems relying on historical and real-time data instead of models. Plenty of research has been conducted in the use of reinforcement learning for demand response applications in the last few years. However, most experiments are difficult to replicate, and the lack of standardization makes the performance of different algorithms difficult, if not impossible, to compare. In this demo, we introduce a new framework, CityLearn, based on the OpenAI Gym Environment, which will allow researchers to implement, share, replicate, and compare their implementations of reinforcement learning for demand response applications more easily. The framework is open source and modular, which allows researchers to modify and customize it, e.g., by adding additional storage, generation, or energy-consuming systems.},

Currently ALVINN takes images from a camera and a laser range finder as input and produces as output the direction the vehicle should travel in order to follow the road. Training has been conducted using simulated road images. Successful tests on the Carnegie Mellon autonomous navigation test vehicle indicate that the network can effectively follow real roads under certain field conditions. The representation developed to perfOIm the task differs dramatically when the networlc is trained under various conditions, suggesting the possibility of a novel adaptive autonomous navigation system capable of tailoring its processing to the conditions at hand.},

@article{rashidinejad2021,
abstract = {Offline (or batch) reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms seek to learn an optimal policy from a fixed dataset without active data collection. Based on the composition of the offline dataset, two main categories of methods are used: imitation learning which is suitable for expert datasets and vanilla offline RL which often requires uniform coverage datasets. From a practical standpoint, datasets often deviate from these two extremes and the exact data composition is usually unknown a priori. To bridge this gap, we present a new offline RL framework that smoothly interpolates between the two extremes of data composition, hence unifying imitation learning and vanilla offline RL. The new framework is centered around a weak version of the concentrability coefficient that measures the deviation from the behavior policy to the expert policy alone. Under this new framework, we further investigate the question on algorithm design: can one develop an algorithm that achieves a minimax optimal rate and also adapts to unknown data composition? To address this question, we consider a lower confidence bound (LCB) algorithm developed based on pessimism in the face of uncertainty in offline RL. We study finite-sample properties of LCB as well as information-theoretic limits in multi-armed bandits, contextual bandits, and Markov decision processes (MDPs). Our analysis reveals surprising facts about optimality rates. In particular, in all three settings, LCB achieves a faster rate of $1/N$ for nearly-expert datasets compared to the usual rate of $1/\sqrt{N}$ in offline RL, where $N$ is the number of samples in the batch dataset. In the case of contextual bandits with at least two contexts, we prove that LCB is adaptively optimal for the entire data composition range, achieving a smooth transition from imitation learning to offline RL. We further show that LCB is almost adaptively optimal in MDPs.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its worth in a series of artificial domains, and is beginning to show some successes in real-world scenarios. However, much of the research advances in RL are often hard to leverage in real-world systems due to a series of assumptions that are rarely satisfied in practice. We present a set of nine unique challenges that must be addressed to productionize RL to real world problems. For each of these challenges, we specify the exact meaning of the challenge, present some approaches from the literature, and specify some metrics for evaluating that challenge. An approach that addresses all nine challenges would be applicable to a large number of real world problems. We also present an example domain that has been modified to present these challenges as a testbed for practical RL research.},
