Electrical power grids are an essential, yet extremely complicated piece infrastructure of city life. Responsible for the generating electricity and delivering it to the final consumers, the sheer sizes of some these power grids are a testimony to the difficulty of managing them. The Synchronous Grid of Continental Europe

, for example, provides electricity to over 400 million people in 24 countries. In

 , two power grids are responsible for providing energy to the entire region, with the exception of Texas, Québec and Alaska. 

Managing such power grids is as complex as it is relevant. Unexpected fluctuations in supply and demand may lead to power shortages (such as the 2003 Northeast Blackout, that affected an estimated 55 million people in US and Canada

[^citation 3]: [Northeast blackout of 2003 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003)

), or to other adverse effects (such as when clocks in Europe ran slow because Kosovo used more electricity than anticipated as a result of its conflict with Serbia in 2018).

. Human tampering is also another cause for concern, as seen in the California, when electricity companies such as Enron deliberately created a shortage in electricity supply in order to inflate the utility's price

. Even when power grids are operating normally, there is still loss due to the complexities of managing such behemoths. In the U.S., for instance, as much as 5% of all generated energy is lost before reaching the customers

, leading states like New York to estimate spending $30 billion dollars in maintaining its electrical power grid over the next decade

To manage such complex systems, some experts look at Smart Grids as a solution, and it has been proposed that both the US

and the EU

 should shift from their current power grids to a smart grid infrastructure. Smart Grids are "smart" in the sense that they identify fluctuations on supply and demand and act based on this information in order to prevent unnecessary losses, thereby increasing the availability of service and reducing its environmental impact.

An important component of this is the algorithm that adjusts the grid in order to keep it functioning despite fluctuations in supply and demand. In this paper, we
