# Goals

This week, I have 3 goals:

1. Train and test on different zones (for all the 9 buildings types and average their costs to yield final result). Train single policy/building with its own local reward using SAC.
2. Train from scratch SAC policy on different zones with default policy initialization.
3. Do transfer learning for different zones.

In other words, I will perform 3 experiments:

Using SAC, run 3 experiments:

**Experiment 1:** 
Train a policy in zone 4 and apply it in zones 1, 2 and 3.
Resulting learning curves should be horizontal

**Experiment 2:**
Train a policy from scratch in zones 1, 2 and 3
Resulting learning curves should exhibit decreasing costs

**Experiment 3: (Transfer Learning)**
Start from policy trained in zone 4.
Apply it to zones 1, 2 and 3, and continue training it there.
Resulting learning curves should be decreasing and achieve costs smaller than in experiment 2.
