# Goals 

All goals from this week build on top of Theme 1.3.

We have three goals for this week:

* To establish a baseline for further assessment of the quality of our optimized policy
* To implement MAML using the selected package
* To implement the Reinforcement Learning algorithm whereby the optimal policy is to be found
