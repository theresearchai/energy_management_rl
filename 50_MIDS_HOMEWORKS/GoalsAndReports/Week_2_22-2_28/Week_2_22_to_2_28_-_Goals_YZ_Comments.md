# Goals 

All goals from this week build on top of Theme 1.3.

We have three goals for this week:

* To establish a baseline for further assessment of the quality of our optimized policy
* To implement MAML using the selected package
* To implement the Reinforcement Learning algorithm whereby the optimal policy is to be found

**Comments by YZ: Please put an estimation for each goal, and describe what you are planning to achieve for each goal. Also, it should be the goals for the next two weeks. **
