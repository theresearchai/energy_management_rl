# Report 

In the previous week, we had the following goals:

* Find a package to enable us to do Meta-Reinforcement Learning within the City Learn environment
* Understand how the decentralized agents problem is implemented in *City Learn*.

Concerning the first goal, it was met. Upon searching the web as a group and discussing our findings among ourselves, we have agreed to use [this]([GitHub - shunzh/pytorch-maml-rl](https://github.com/shunzh/pytorch-maml-rl)) package to implement Meta-RL.

Concerning the second goal, which was intimately related to the issue of information sharing between agents, we have agreed it to be best not to implement information sharing at this point. Further exploration will take place this week, as we implement a baseline model on a decentralized framework.
