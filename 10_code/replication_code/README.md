# CityLearn
CityLearn is an open source OpenAI Gym environment for the implementation of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) for building energy coordination and demand response in cities. Its objective is to facilitiate and standardize the evaluation of RL agents such that different algorithms can be easily compared with each other.
![Demand-response](https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/images/dr.jpg)
## Description
Districts and cities have periods of high demand for electricity, which raise electricity prices and the overall cost of the power distribution networks. Flattening, smoothening, and reducing the overall curve of electrical demand helps reduce operational and capital costs of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution networks. Demand response is the coordination of electricity consuming agents (i.e. buildings) in order to reshape the overall curve of electrical demand.
CityLearn allows the easy implementation of reinforcement learning agents in a multi-agent setting to reshape their aggregated curve of electrical demand by controlling the storage of energy by every agent. Currently, CityLearn allows controlling the storage of domestic hot water (DHW), and chilled water (for sensible cooling and dehumidification). CityLearn also includes models of air-to-water heat pumps, electric heaters, solar photovoltaic arrays, and the pre-computed energy loads of the buildings, which include space cooling, dehumidification, appliances, DHW, and solar generation.
## Requirements
CityLearn requires the installation of the following Python libraries:
- Pandas 0.24.2 or older
- Numpy 1.16.4 or older
- Gym 0.14.0

### Building
The DHW and cooling demands of the buildings have been pre-computed and obtained from EnergyPlus. The DHW and cooling supply systems are sized such that the DHW and cooling demands are always satisfied. CityLearn automatically sets constraints to the actions from the controllers to guarantee that the DHW and cooling demands are satisfied, and that the building does not receive from the storage units more energy than it needs. 
The file building_attributes.json contains the attributes of each building, which can be modified. We do not advise to modify the attributes Building -> HeatPump -> nominal_power and Building -> ElectricHeater -> nominal_power from their default value "autosize", as they guarantee that the DHW and cooling demand are always satisfied.

  - ```set_storage_heating()``` and ```set_storage_cooling()``` set the state of charge of the ```EnergyStorage``` device to the specified value and within the physical constraints of the system.

  - ```get_non_shiftable_load()```, ```get_solar_power()```, ```get_dhw_electric_demand()``` and ```get_cooling_electric_demand()``` get the different types of electricity demand and generation.
  
### Heat pump
Its efficiency is given by the coefficient of performance (COP), which is calculated as a function of the outdoor air temperature and of the following parameters:

-```eta_tech```: technical efficiency of the heat pump

-```T_target```: target temperature. Conceptually, it is  equal to the logarithmic mean of the temperature of the supply water of the storage device and the temperature of the water returning from the building. Here it is assumed to be constant and defined by the user in the [building_attributes.json](/data/building_attributes.json) file.  For cooling, values between 7C and 10C are reasonable.
Any amount of cooling demand of the building that isn't satisfied by the ```EnergyStorage``` device is automatically supplied by the ```HeatPump``` directly to the ```Building```, guaranteeing that the cooling demand is always satisfied. The ```HeatPump``` is more efficient (has a higher COP) if the outdoor air temperature is lower, and less efficient (lower COP) when the outdoor temperature is higher (typically during the day time). On the other hand, the electricity demand is typically higher during the daytime and lower at night. ```cooling_energy_generated = COP*electricity_consumed, COP > 1```
- Attributes
  - ```cop_heating```: coefficient of performance for heating supply
  - ```cop_cooling```:  coefficient of performance for cooling supply
  - ```electrical_consumption_cooling```: electricity consumed for cooling supply (kWh)
  - ```electrical_consumption_heating```: electricity consumed for heating supply (kWh)
  - ```heat_supply```: heating supply (kWh)
  - ```cooling_supply```: cooling supply (kWh)
- Methods
  - ```get_max_cooling_power()``` and ```get_max_heating_power()``` compute the maximum amount of heating or cooling that the heat pump can provide based on its nominal power of the compressor and its COP. 
  - ```get_electric_consumption_cooling()``` and ```get_electric_consumption_heating()``` return the amount of electricity consumed by the heat pump for a given amount of supplied heating or cooling energy.
### Energy storage
Storage devices allow heat pumps to store energy that can be later released into the building. Typically every building will have its own storage device, but CityLearn also allows defining a single instance of the ```EnergyStorage``` for multiple instances of the class ```Building```, therefore having a group of buildings sharing a same energy storage device.

- Attributes
  - ```soc```: state of charge (kWh)
  - ```energy_balance```: energy coming in (if positive) or out (if negative) of the energy storage device (kWh)

- Methods
  - ```charge()``` increases (+) or decreases (-) of the amount of energy stored. The input is the amount of energy as a ratio of the total capacity of the storage device (can vary from -1 to 1). Outputs the energy balance of the storage device.
## Environment variables
The file [buildings_state_action_space.json](/buildings_state_action_space.json) contains all the states and action variables that the buildings can possibly return:
### Possible states
- ```month```: 1 (January) through 12 (December)
- ```day```: type of day as provided by EnergyPlus (from 1 to 8). 1 (Sunday), 2 (Monday), ..., 7 (Saturday), 8 (Holiday)
- ```hour```: hour of day (from 1 to 24).
- ```daylight_savings_status```: indicates if the building is under daylight savings period (0 to 1). 0 indicates that the building has not changed its electricity consumption profiles due to daylight savings, while 1 indicates the period in which the building may have been affected.
- ```t_out```: outdoor temperature in Celcius degrees.
- ```t_out_pred_6h```: outdoor temperature predicted 6h ahead (accuracy: +-0.3C)
- ```t_out_pred_12h```: outdoor temperature predicted 12h ahead (accuracy: +-0.65C)
- ```t_out_pred_24h```: outdoor temperature predicted 24h ahead (accuracy: +-1.35C)
- ```rh_out```: outdoor relative humidity in %.
- ```rh_out_pred_6h```: outdoor relative humidity predicted 6h ahead (accuracy: +-2.5%)
- ```rh_out_pred_12h```: outdoor relative humidity predicted 12h ahead (accuracy: +-5%)
- ```rh_out_pred_24h```: outdoor relative humidity predicted 24h ahead (accuracy: +-10%)
- ```diffuse_solar_rad```: diffuse solar radiation in W/m^2.
- ```diffuse_solar_rad_pred_6h```: diffuse solar radiation predicted 6h ahead (accuracy: +-2.5%)
- ```diffuse_solar_rad_pred_12h```: diffuse solar radiation predicted 12h ahead (accuracy: +-5%)
- ```diffuse_solar_rad_pred_24h```: diffuse solar radiation predicted 24h ahead (accuracy: +-10%)
- ```direct_solar_rad```: direct solar radiation in W/m^2.
- ```direct_solar_rad_pred_6h```: direct solar radiation predicted 6h ahead (accuracy: +-2.5%)
- ```direct_solar_rad_pred_12h```: direct solar radiation predicted 12h ahead (accuracy: +-5%)
- ```direct_solar_rad_pred_24h```: direct solar radiation predicted 24h ahead (accuracy: +-10%)
- ```t_in```: indoor temperature in Celcius degrees.
- ```avg_unmet_setpoint```: average difference between the indoor temperatures and the cooling temperature setpoints in the different zones of the building in Celcius degrees. sum((t_in - t_setpoint).clip(min=0) * zone_volumes)/total_volume
- ```rh_in```: indoor relative humidity in %.
- ```non_shiftable_load```: electricity currently consumed by electrical appliances in kWh.
- ```solar_gen```: electricity currently being generated by photovoltaic panels in kWh.
- ```cooling_storage_soc```: state of the charge (SOC) of the cooling storage device. From 0 (no energy stored) to 1 (at full capacity).
- ```dhw_storage_soc```: state of the charge (SOC) of the domestic hot water (DHW) storage device. From 0 (no energy stored) to 1 (at full capacity).
- ```net_electricity_consumption```: net electricity consumption of the building (including all energy systems) in the current time step.

### Possible actions
C determines the capacity of the storage device and is defined as a multiple of the maximum thermal energy consumption by the building.
- ```cooling_storage```: increase (action > 0) or decrease (action < 0) of the amount of cooling energy stored in the cooling storage device. -1/C <= action <= 1/C (attempts to decrease or increase the cooling energy stored in the storage device by an amount equal to the action times the storage device's maximum capacity). In order to decrease the energy stored in the device (action < 0), the energy must be released into the building's cooling system. Therefore, the state of charge will not decrease proportionally to the action taken if the demand for cooling of the building is lower than the action times the maximum capacity of the cooling storage device.
- ```dhw_storage```: increase (action > 0) or decrease (action < 0) of the amount of DHW stored in the DHW storage device. -1/C <= action <= 1/C (attempts to decrease or increase the DHW stored in the storage device by an amount equivalent to action times its maximum capacity). In order to decrease the energy stored in the device, the energy must be released into the building. Therefore, the state of charge will not decrease proportionally to the action taken if the demand for DHW of the building is lower than the action times the maximum capacity of the DHW storage device.

Note that the action of the user-implemented controller can be bounded between -1/C and 1/C because the capacity of the storage unit, C, is defined as a multiple of the maximum thermal energy consumption by the building. For instance, if C_cooling = 3 and the peak cooling energy consumption of the building during the simulation is 20 kWh, then the storage unit will have a total capacity of 60 kWh.

The mathematical formulation of the effects of the actions can be found in the methods ```set_storage_heating(action)``` and ```set_storage_cooling(action)``` of the class Building in the file [energy_models.py](/energy_models.py).
### Reward function
The reward function must be defined by the user by changing one of the two functions in the file [reward_function.py](/reward_function.py).

For a central single-agent (if CityLearn class attribtue ```central_agent = True```):
- ```reward_function_sa```: it takes the total net electricity consumption of each building (< 0 if generation is higher than demand) at a given time and returns a single reward for the central agent.

For a decentralized multi-agent controller  (if CityLearn class attribtue ```central_agent = False```):
- ```reward_function_ma```: it takes the total net electricity consumption of each building (< 0 if generation is higher than demand) at a given time and returns a list with as many rewards as the number of agents.

By modifying these functions the user changes the reward that the CityLearn environment returns every time the method .step(a) is called.

### Performance metrics
```env.cost()``` is returns the performance metrics of the environment, which the RL controller must minimize. There are multiple metrics available, which are all defined as a function of the total non-negative net electricity consumption of the whole neighborhood:
- ```ramping```: sum(|e(t)-e(t-1)|), where e is the net non-negative electricity consumption every time-step.
- ```1-load_factor```: the load factor is the average net electricity load divided by the maximum electricity load.
- ```average_daily_peak```: average daily peak net demand.
- ```peak_demand```: maximum peak electricity demand
- ```net_electricity_consumption```: total amount of electricity consumed
- ```quadratic```: sum(e^2), where e is the net non-negative electricity consumption every time-step. (Not used in The CityLearn Challenge).

All these metrics are divided by the metrics of a reference rule-based controller (RBC). Therefore, any metric > 1 is worse than that of the RBC, and < 1 means that the controller is minimizing that metric better than the RBC. Since the metrics are normalized using the RBC results, it is possible to have results in which for example ```average_daily_peak``` > ```peak_demand```. This just means that the RL controller minimized the total peak demand more than it minimized the average daily peak demand with respect to the RBC.

## Additional functions
- ```building_loader(demand_file, weather_file, buildings)``` receives a dictionary with all the building instances and their respectives IDs, and loads them with the data of heating and cooling loads from the simulations.
- ```auto_size(buildings, t_target_heating, t_target_cooling)``` automatically sizes the heat pumps and the storage devices. It assumes fixed target temperatures of the heat pump for heating and cooling, which combines with weather data to estimate their hourly COP for the simulated period. The ```HeatPump``` is sized such that it will always be able to fully satisfy the heating and cooling demands of the building. This function also sizes the ```EnergyStorage``` devices, setting their capacity as 3 times the maximum hourly cooling demand in the simulated period.
## Multi-agent coordination
### One building
  - A good control policy for cooling is trivial, and consists on storing cooling energy during the night (when the cooling demand of the building is low and the COP of the heat pump is higher), and releasing the stored cooling energy into the building during the day (high demand for cooling and low COP). 
### Multiple buildings
  - If controlled independently of each other and without coordination or sharing any information, the buildings will tend to consume more electricity simultaneously, which may not be optimal if the objective is peak reduction and load flattening. 
### [Challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/citylearnchallenge)
Coordinate multiple RL agents or a single centralized agent to control all the buildings. The agents may share certain information with each other. The objective is to reduce the cost function by smoothing, reducing, and flattening the total net demand for electricity in the whole district. Electric heaters supplies the heating energy for the DHW system (no air heating), and air-to-water heat pumps provide cooling energy for the building.

## Asked questions for The CityLearn Challenge
- After running the agents, the average_daily_peak cost is higher than the the peak_demand cost. How is this possible? The annual peak demand should always be higher than the avergae daily peak.

All the costs are normalized by the costs a rule-based controller would have. Therefore, the different costs are normalized by different values and that is why the average_daily_peak cost may be higher than the peak_demand cost. To see the factors by which they are being normalized, you can run env.cost_rbc after the environment has run through at least one episode.

- It seems that the building heating_by_device is supplied by electric heater exclusively and cooling_by_device  by heat pump exclusively. So it is correct to assume that the heat pump does not provide heating at all?

In the models provided for the challenge, the heat pump only provides cooling, and the DHW is only provided by the electric heater. Not all buildings have DHW demand and the electric heater supplying it, but all the buildings do have a heat pump supplying cooling energy.

- Do we have limits on storage SOC (Minimum & maximum amount of thermal energy at any given time step)? From cooling_storage_soc it seems that it can be 0 or 1 (full capacity).

Yes, it can be 0 (empty) and 1 (full capacity), or any value in between at any time-steps. The cooling or DHW demands of the building and the power of the energy supply devices also limit the additional energy that can be stored or released on any of theses storage devices at any given time-step.

- Can we use future hour heating, cooling electrical appliances energy / electricity demand as ‘predictions’ for the current time step action selection_ provided in each building file? Such that one of the state for determine if to supply heating by device would be “future demand for heating”? I don’t see them in the possible states…

We provide as states those variables that we could easily obtained in a real-world implementation. You can only use as states those variables we have provided as such, in the file buildings_state_action_space.json. However, instead of using the predicted values of generation, cooling or heating, you can use other variables as states that are good predictors of those variables. For example, the solar irradiation is a good predictor of the solar generation, the outdoor temperature (and the relative humidity to some extent) are also good predictors of the demand for cooling, and the current electricity consumption from non-shiftable loads may also be a decent predictor of the electricity consumption in the next hour. 
It's also worth mentioning that within your controller you can do any feature engineering you want using these observed variables that CityLearn returns. You need to use these observed variables from the  buildings_state_action_space.json only, but you can process them as you wish within your controller.

- Is electric_generation the net solar_gen?

Yes, it is the solar generation.

- Does electric_ consumption_dhw(t) + electrical_consumption_dhw_storage(t) = electrical_consumption_heating(t)? 
electric_consumption_dhw = sum of electrical_consumption_heating across all buildings. It already includes any additional heating energy consumed by the DHW storage (if you are increasing its SOC), or any reduction in the heating demand if you are decreasing the SOC of the DHW storage device.

The variable electrical_consumption_dhw_storage is the increase or reduction in the electrical demand for heating resulting from increasing or decreasing the SOC

- How do I represent the action selection whether the use solar_gen at this time step or use electricity from grid (for either electric_consumption_appliances or electricity for heat pumps and electric heaters) to reflect the change in state of electricity prices and solar power availability (solar_gen which is related with solar radiation prediction)? I understand that the solar generation will also happen but the agent can decide not to use the electricity generation at this time step when the electricity pricing is cheap but use it later when the electricity price is higher…

There are no actual electricity prices that need to be used. The default reward functions provided with the environment come with some virtual electricity prices that are proportional to the overall net electrical demand in the district. This creates a reward function that depends on the squared value of the electrical consumption: price = constant * net_electric_consumption, reward = price * net_electric_consumption = constant * net_electric_consumption^2. 
This default reward function should incentivize the agent(s) to flatten the curve of net electrical demand. However, you don't need to use this reward function (feel free to modify it if you think of a better reward function), there are no actual electricity prices, and the objective of the challenge is to do load-shaping a minimize the 5 metrics provided in the cost function: ramping, 1-load_factor (one minus load factor), the average daily peak of net electricity consumption, the maximum peak demand of that year, and the non-negative net electricity consumption.
The control actions are simply the storage or release of energy from the storage devices, and the overall objective is to make the net electrical demand of the district as flat, smooth and low as possible in order to minimize the aforementioned 5 cost metrics. The electricity generation and demand from appliances is already determined and going to happen regardless of the actions you take.
