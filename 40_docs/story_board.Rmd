# Storyboard
# Epic 1

We aim to use reinforcement learning to build a model that can assist actors managing a power grid system to maintain the stability of power generation and distribution in the event of an attack or failure of a small portion of the power grid. Through building the model we are expected to write paper and submit to the conference. 

## Theme 1.1

We need to first learn reinforcement learning and different technques in order to build a efficient model. 

### Story 1.1.1 (finished)
We are going to take some video lecture provided by different institutions.

#### Status
Finished

### Story 1.1.2
We are going to meet with our clients to discuss about what we learned. Clients will teach us on topics in more detail that we are confused about.


## Theme 1.2

We need to get familiarity with simulators like city-learn. 

### Story 1.2.1

We will first do some eda to understand how city-learn works.

#### Status

Finished(We actually met original scholars to ask question on the simulator)

### Story 1.2.2

We will replicate the result of original paper

#### Status

Finished

## Theme 1.3

We will start implementing algorithms into city-learn or different simulators and evaluate the performance for each algorithms. 

### Story 1.3.1

Implement few algorithm that we have thought in order to improve the model

#### part1 

Implement autocorrelation into original pipeline

#### part2

Implement recurrent neural network into original pipeline

#### part3

Use moving variance to capture the volatility of demand curve for reward function

### Story 1.3.2

We will read different most updated papers on reinforcement learning and apply those model into our environment. 

## Theme 1.4

We will start writing our results into a paper for submission in conference

### Story 1.4.1

Start reading relevant research papers to write introduction

### Story 1.4.2

Start visualzing our results for paper

### Story 1.4.3

Start reading research paper from domain field to improve the given simulator. 

## Theme 1.5

We will start working to produce a conference paper

### Story 1.5.1

Start organizing our result and write them into a paper
