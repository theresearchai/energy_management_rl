# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Power System Service Restoratio

Demand response can help buildings play an active role in the generation and storage of electricity by coordinating with each other to increase demand flexibility and provide load shaping capabilities. For this objective, in this research, we focus on proposing and implementing reinforcement learning (RI) algorithms that each agent manages each building and they cooperatively control the energy storage communicating with each other. As a simulation environment. we took advantage of [CityLearn](https://sites.google.com/view/citylearnchallenge).
